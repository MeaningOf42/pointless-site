<h1 id="what-is-this-">What is this?</h1>
<p>This is the source code for my pointless site <a href="">available here</a>. The pointless site host code that does trivial tasks in pointlessly obscure, long winded and fun ways. I could claim the site aims to teach new and potentially useful coding practices through humour, but really that isn't the case: this site is pointless for the mere sake of being pointless.</p>
